1. **Content-Type Header:**
 Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` to indicate that you are sending JSON data in the request body.

2. **Authorization Header (Optional):**
If your NestJS application requires authentication, you might need to include an `Authorization` header with a token or credentials. This depends on your application's authentication mechanism.
