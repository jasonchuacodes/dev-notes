Suppose you have two models User and Post. Each post belongs to a user, so you want to define a relation between them.
```js
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id       Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  author   User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}
```

In the `User model`, we define a one-to-many relation with the `Post model` using the posts *field*. The @relation attribute specifies the relation name as userPosts.

In the `Post model`, we define a many-to-one relation with the `User model` using the author field. The @relation attribute with the fields argument specifies that the relation is established using the authorId field in the Post model. The references argument specifies that the relation references the id field in the User model.

#### Notes 

* In setting up prisma schema, scalar fields are the ones that appear in queries and tables. @relations are only there to define the relationship between models. This took me a while to understand when doing my exercises

* In the example above, we need to take note that in order to establish a 1-n relation between `User` and `Post` , we needed to defined the *Foreign key* via the relation scalar field of Post.
```js
model Post {
  id       Int  @id @default(autoincrement())
  author   User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int
}
```

Let's break this down, `@relation(fields: [authId], reference: [id])`
	`@relation` - is the attribute that defines that this field as a relation scalar field
	`fields` - is the first argument that points to the scalar field authorId which gives our author an id value. authorId - being a scalar field - does not appear in the database
	`references` - is the second argument that points the the referenced column in the User entity
