Include and Select are query modifiers used to specify which fields should be included in the result set and which related records should be retrieved.

Here's an example that demonstrates the difference between `select` and `include`.

Let's say you have two tables: User and Post. 
Each post is linked to a user by a foreign key. 
Each user has many posts.

#### Include
If you want to retrieve all of the posts for a specific user, you could use the `include` field:
```js
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    id: 1,
  },
  include: {
    posts: true,
  },
})
```

	The retrieved data would include posts: 
```js
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'John',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  posts: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'My first post',
      content: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet',
      userId: 1,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'My second post',
      content: 'Consectetur adipiscing elit',
      userId: 1,
    },
    // ... more posts
  ],
}
```

#### Select
On the other hand, if you only want to retrieve the name and email fields for the user, you could use the `select` field:
```js
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    id: 1,
  },
  select: {
    name: true,
    email: true,
  },
})
```

	 In this case, the select field specifies that only the name and email fields should be included in the result set. This will return an object that looks like this:
```js
{
  name: 'John',
  email: 'john@example.com',
}
```
