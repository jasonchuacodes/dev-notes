Laravel is a backend framework that is built on top of [[PHP]].  

It mainly uses the MVC Pattern for development. 

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software design pattern used in web development to separate the logic of a web application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.

The *Model* represents the data structure and interacts with the database. 
The *View* displays the data to the user. 
The *Controller* acts as an intermediary, receiving input from the user, processing it, and updating the Model accordingly.

Here are some useful concepts in Laravel:
- [[Model]]
- [[Controller]]
- [[Form Request]]
- [[Web Routes]]
- [[Api Routes]]
- [[Migration]]
