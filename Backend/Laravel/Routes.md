After creating a new route in web.php or api.php, you need to run `php artisan route:clear` and `php artisan route:cache` in so that the new changes will be compiled in Laravel.

1.  `route:clear`: This command clears the route cache. Laravel compiles all of the application's routes into a single file for performance reasons. If you make any changes to your application's routes, you need to run this command to clear the cache and allow the new routes to be compiled.
2.  `route:cache`: This command caches the application's routes. Compiling the routes into a single file can help speed up the performance of the application. However, any changes to the routes will not be picked up until you clear the cache using `route:clear`.
3.  `cache:clear`: This command clears the entire application cache. Laravel caches various things such as config files, views, and routes for performance reasons. This command will clear all of the cached files and force Laravel to rebuild them.
4.  `optimize`: This command optimizes the application for production use. It clears the application cache, compiles all of the routes, and performs other optimizations to improve performance. This command is intended to be run in a production environment and should not be run during development.

By running `php artisan optimize`, you won't have the need to manually run the other commands. But generally this command is intended for production, not development.
