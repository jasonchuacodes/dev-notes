The @canModel directive in Laravel Lighthouse provides a way to implement role-based access control (RBAC) for GraphQL operations. 

1. Purpose of @canModel:
   - Integrates Laravel's authorization system with GraphQL mutations
   - Enables role-based access control (RBAC) for GraphQL operations
   - Centralizes authorization logic in Laravel policies

2. Example GraphQL Mutation:
   ```graphql
   type Mutation {
       updateThread(input: UpdateThreadInput! @spread): Thread
           @guard
           @canModel(
               ability: "update"
               injectArgs: true
               model: "App\\Models\\Thread"
           )
           @field(resolver: "App\\GraphQL\\Mutations\\UpdateThreadMutation")
   }
   ```

3. @canModel Directive Breakdown:
   - `ability: "update"`: Specifies the policy method to check
   - `injectArgs: true`: Passes mutation arguments to the policy method
   - `model: "App\\Models\\Thread"`: Defines the model class for authorization

4. Authorization Flow:
   - When the mutation is called, Lighthouse invokes the ThreadPolicy's `update` method
   - The policy method determines if the authenticated user can perform the update action
   - If authorized, the mutation proceeds; otherwise, an authorization error is returned

5. Implementing the Policy:
   - Define the `update` method in ThreadPolicy:
     ```php
     class ThreadPolicy
     {
         public function update(User $user, Thread $thread)
         {
             // Role-based logic, e.g.:
             return $user->hasRole('moderator') || $user->id === $thread->user_id;
         }
     }
     ```
7. Benefits of This Approach:
   - Separates authorization logic from GraphQL resolvers
   - Reuses existing Laravel authorization mechanisms
   - Allows for fine-grained, role-based access control
   - Keeps authorization consistent across REST and GraphQL APIs

8. Considerations:
   - Ensure policies are registered in AuthServiceProvider (*IMPORTANT!*)
   - Policy methods should return boolean values

Key Takeaways:
- @canModel directive provides a clean, declarative way to implement RBAC in GraphQL mutations
- Leverages Laravel's policy system for consistent authorization across the application
- Allows for centralized, reusable authorization logic that can be applied to multiple GraphQL operations
- Enhances security by ensuring proper authorization checks are performed before executing sensitive operations
