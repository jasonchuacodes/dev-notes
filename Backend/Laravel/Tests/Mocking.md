`Mocking` is a technique used in testing where the behavior of one or more dependencies is replaced with a simulation, in order to isolate the component being tested and to control the behavior of its dependencies.

Hereâ€™s an example of mocking used in Laravel Test importing an excel file:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

public function test_import_excel_file()
{
    // Create a mock file in memory
    $mockFile = tmpfile();
    fwrite($mockFile, 'column1,column2,column3
    value1,value2,value3
    value4,value5,value6');

    // Create a fake disk for testing
    Storage::fake('temp');

    // Save the mock file to the fake disk
    $file = stream_get_meta_data($mockFile)['uri'];
    Storage::disk('temp')->put('import.csv', file_get_contents($file));

    // Execute the import command, passing the file path as an argument
    $this->artisan('import:file', ['file' => $file])
        ->expectsOutput('Import completed successfully.')
        ->assertExitCode(0);

    // Verify that the data was inserted into the database as expected
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('table_name', [
        'column1' => 'value1',
        'column2' => 'value2',
        'column3' => 'value3',
    ]);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('table_name', [
        'column1' => 'value4',
        'column2' => 'value5',
        'column3' => 'value6',
    ]);

    // Clean up the mock file
    fclose($mockFile);
}
```
