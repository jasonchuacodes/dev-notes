the `every()` method in JavaScript is a boolean method. It is used to test whether all elements in an array pass the test implemented by the provided function. The function provided to `every()` should return a boolean value.

In your specific code:
```js
const isAllAssignedJob = jobs.every((job) =>
  checkIsAssignedJob({ job, userId }),
);
```
The `isAllAssignedJob` variable will be `true` if the `checkIsAssignedJob` function returns `true` for every element in the `jobs` array. Otherwise, it will be `false`.
