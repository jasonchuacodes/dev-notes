In Vue, both `reactive()` and `ref()` are used to create reactive data in your components, but they have slightly different use cases.

### Reactive
1. `reactive()`: This function is used to create a reactive object that can contain multiple properties. When you wrap an object with `reactive()`, any changes to its properties will trigger reactivity and update the relevant components that depend on them. You typically use `reactive()` when you have complex data structures or need to track multiple properties together.
```js
import { reactive } from 'vue';

const state = reactive({
  count: 0,
  message: 'Hello!',
});

console.log(state.count) // Output: 0

// let's update the value of count

state.count = 5;
console.log(state.count) // Output: 5
```

In the above example, both `count` and `message` properties will be reactive, and any changes to them will trigger updates in components that use these properties.

### watchEffect
Commonly used with `reactive()` is the `watchEffect()` API. This runs a function immediately while reactively tracking its dependencies and re-runs it whenever the dependencies are changed.
```js
import { reactive, watchEffect } from 'vue'

const state = reactive({
  count: 0
})

watchEffect(() => {
  console.log(state.count)
}) // Output: 0

state.count++ // Output: 1
```

### Ref
2. `ref()`: This function is used to create a reactive reference to a single value. It creates a simple wrapper around the value and provides reactive behavior to that value. You typically use `ref()` when you have a single value that you want to be reactive.
```js
import { ref } from 'vue';

const count = ref(0);
```
In this case, `count` is a reactive reference to the value `0`. If you modify `count.value`, it will trigger reactivity and update components that depend on it.

### toRefs
3. `toRefs()`: This function in Vue serves a specific purpose when working with reactive objects created using `reactive()`. While `ref()` and `reactive()` provide reactivity, `toRefs()` helps with more granular reactivity tracking at the property level within a reactive object.

The main purpose of `toRefs()` is to convert a reactive object into an object where each property is a separate `ref`. This allows you to track reactivity at the individual property level rather than the entire object. It is particularly useful when you want to pass individual reactive properties as props to child components or when using the Composition API.

```js
import { reactive, toRefs } from 'vue';

const state = reactive({
  count: 0,
  message: 'Hello!',
});

const stateRefs = toRefs(state);

console.log(stateRefs.count.value); // Accessing the count property using .value
console.log(stateRefs.message.value); // Accessing the message property using .value
```
