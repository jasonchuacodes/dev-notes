In the context of the Vue 3 Composition API, the term `context` refers to an object that is provided to the `setup` function. It contains various properties, utilities, and methods that can be used within the component setup.

The context object typically includes the following properties:
-   `attrs`: An object containing the non-prop attributes (`v-bind="$attrs"`) passed to the component.
-   `slots`: An object containing the component's slots (`$slots`).
-   `emit`: A function used to emit custom events (`$emit`).
-   `expose`: A function that allows exposing properties or methods to the parent component (`$options.expose`).

The context object is automatically passed as the second argument to the `setup` function. By destructuring the context, you can directly access its properties without explicitly referencing `context.propertyName`.
