Here are some common events you can use with `window.addEventListener`:

1. `resize`: Fires when the window is resized.
2. `scroll`: Fires when the document view or an element has been scrolled.
3. `load`: Fires when the entire page has finished loading, including all frames, objects, and images.
4. `unload`: Fires when the user navigates away from the page.
5. `orientationchange`: Fires when the orientation of the device changes (portrait to landscape or vice versa).
6. `beforeunload`: Fires before the user navigates away from the page, allowing you to show a confirmation dialog (not recommended for abuse).
