This tool/application aims to solve problems faced by legal practitioners in Western Australia particularly when it comes to matters from Legal Aid. Such problems include tracking the list of all the matters from Legal Aid, as well as billing.

Some of my responsibilities in this project was creating responsive markups and API integration.

Notable insights that I learned in this project was to develop the app using Next Framework.
