Question:
What is meant by this column rule?
  For old reference data, if `available` state changes, display the change. 
  And then `keep the previous value of activated/deactivated`. If the ref data is initially `activated` and then we set the lieferbar state to `unavailable`, will it still be `activated`?

What happens in this step?
  Will it do calculations and rendering of some sorts with the set articles in the portfolio?

What kind of errors could we encounter in the `deploying to production` process? 
Is it possible to `cancel` the `deploying to production process`?
